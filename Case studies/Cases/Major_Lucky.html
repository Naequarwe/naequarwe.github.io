                <div class="letter">
                    <p>
                        Lucky was a strange figure, he was raised as if he was a clone but he was born
                        from a mother and father unlike his brothers-in-arms, one thing that confuses us is
                        how he was born by parents but no one knew not even him, perhaps it was a secret
                        a very well kept secret...according to our research his mother is still alive but 
                        we aren't sure where we could locate her, if we find her maybe she could give us 
                        information but we don't wish to push for it at this point.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        back to the topic at hand lucky was a clone who could use the force at a high power but
                        decided not to because he found the blaster an easier tool, yet he is intuitive, has a
                        natural understanding of melee...but this could be due to the clone training he went through
                        now that we think about it maybe he is just being watched over by a jedi not actually a jedi.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Other points about luckys nature is he will follow any directive he is given to point, he cares
                        about his squad over anything and will try his best to prevent putting those who don't deserve to
                        put up with horrors of war into his squad (apart from his clone brothers mainly due to the support
                        they give him) his mental state doesn't seem to be stable but he manages to prevent the sorrows of
                        the war from being shown along with preventing them from distracting him, his mental control is
                        extrodinary.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At one point one of our watchers had noticed his luck...its unusually high, he has suffered many
                        nearly fatal hits, but somehow survived and even the best shots have missed due to an unusual thing
                        for example once a scout trooper had his scope set on lucky but just before the scout shot his
                        sniper jammed not too long after lucky had engaged troopers and the scout trooper was shot down by 
                        epsilon, his unusal luck has saved him more then most realize but as he got closer to his squad he
                        started running out of luck...is this because he found proper care, maybe they created a vulnerability
                        or even the key to killing lucky was killing him when he relied on his squad...
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We wonder...

                <h3 style="color: #8a0303; font-family: AVP; font-size: 200%;">Weaponry and armour</h3>

                <div class="letter">
                    <p>
                        Luckys Arsenal consist of basic weapons but a few of his own little creation these creations mainly
                        consist of melee weapons like vibrodaggers, though instead of a plasma like blade it goes back to a more 
                        primitive state, metal scrap that has been made out of remains of ships, transports and even droids
                        and their weapons, his other weaponry are your basic clone outfit:
                        <ol>
                            <li>DC-15A Blaster Rifle</li>
                            <li>DC-17 Blaster Pistol</li>
                            <li>DC-15X Sniper Rifle</li>
                            <li>A belt of Baradium-Core Code Key Thermal Detonators</li>
                        </ol>

                        He has a nack for using the DC-17 Blaster Pistol and all his equipment has a '&#923;' carved on it with a four-leaf clover
                        he also aced in pilot, his armour is a bit more unique...
                        
                        it may seem like normal clone armour that has been coloured to luckys preferences but it also has a concealed slot
                        that houses a melee contraption lucky made on his way back to naboo from hoth, and from what we have seen he has 
                        managed to use it as if he was trained with it before.

                <div class="letter">
                    Lucky has shown an extrodinary set of skills here is a list of what we have been able to solidify
                    in his skill set but we are sure there is more to him:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sharp eyed</li>
                        <li>Adaptable</li>

                        <li>Reliable</li>
                        <li>Respectful</li>
                        <li>Caring</li>
