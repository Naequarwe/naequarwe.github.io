# naequarwe.github.io
The official HTML website of GlitchOut Co.

this is just a website that was originally made just for fun until I decided that I would go further...

what I decided to implement is:

|> a place people can read through creations and add a bit of fun and searching into their life

|> A fun and technological-esque design

|> a small 'training area' for my own hobby

to get your service/s advertized feel free to use the Contact us service in the site and we will have a look.
